# macOS setup

## Backup old system

1. Remove licenses and deactivate software:
	* Creative Suite
	* Moom
	* Sublime Text
	* iTunes
	* GitHub SSH
1. Backup files
	* Moom PLIST
	* Rest PLIST
1. Delete mail accounts

## Setup new system

After installation of OS is complete, follow next instructions. They’re not "set in stone" so you can probably mix and match them, but I’ve found that this order produces most desirable outcome.

1. Check for and install software updates via Mac App Store.

1. [Check if `/usr/local` has proper permissions (or does it even exists)](https://github.com/inglesp/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/El_Capitan_and_Homebrew.md).

1. Install XCode CLI tools.

	```sh
	xcode-select --install
	```

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), following these [instructions](http://brew.sh/#install). Ignore warning if Homebrew is not available in `PATH`, it will be available when following step is completed.

1. Get and run [dotfiles](https://github.com/niksy/dotfiles) setup. Follow instructions after everything is done.

	```sh
	cd ~
	mkdir .dotfiles
	cd .dotfiles
	git clone https://github.com/niksy/dotfiles.git .
	sh dotfiles link
	```

1. Set Terminal profile to `~/.dotfiles/.init/niksy.terminal` and set it as default profile.

1. Install Homebrew packages and all other packages.

	```sh
	cd ~
	source .dotfiles/.brew
	```

1. Add config data to `.extra`.

	```sh
	cd ~
	touch .extra
	echo 'export DOTFILES_COMPUTER_NAME="_COMPUTERNAME_";' >> .extra
	```

1. Add Git config data to `.gitconfig_extra`.

	```sh
	cd ~
	touch .gitconfig_extra
	git config --file .gitconfig_extra user.name "_NAME_"
	git config --file .gitconfig_extra user.email "_EMAIL_"
	```

1. Run `.macos`. **Don’t forget to set proper password when asked for sudo permissions!**

	```sh
	cd ~
	source .dotfiles/.macos
	```

1. Run `.macos_extra`.

	```sh
	cd ~
	source .dotfiles/.macos_extra
	```

1. Create SSH config.

	```sh
	mkdir .ssh
	cd ~/.ssh
	touch config
	```

1. Follow [instructions on proper SSH config usage under macOS](https://github.com/niksy/knowledge/blob/master/development/ssh-keys.md#use-keychain-on-macos-1012).

1. Set SSH keys, optionally following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-mac). These instructions will generate key for GitHub.

	```sh
	cd ~/.ssh
	ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "_EMAIL_"
	pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub
	# Add to github.com settings…
	ssh -T git@github.com
	```

1. Install Node, npm and packages.

	````sh
	nvm install 12
	source .dotfiles/.packages
	```
